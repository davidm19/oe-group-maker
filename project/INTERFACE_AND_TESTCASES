INTERFACE:
1. select trip from database
2. algorithm step 1
3. algorithm step 2
4. algorithm step 3
5. export list in some format

TESTCASES:
- test if we can successfully select trip
- test if we can pass in a trip that doesn't exist
- test if we can select students at various points in a list/or pass in a student that doesn't exist
- test preferences at various points/or test preferences that don't exist
- check if algorithm steps work independently of each other
- check if algorithm works as a whole
