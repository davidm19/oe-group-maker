HP = Hold Proposal

Step 1
1) Everybody chooses their own partners
2) For a set of n people, run a loop n times.
3) n[0].HP = True
4) Loop through a, where a is the amount of times we've already looped through
5) check if n[0] == a[0]
6) if ^^ is true, then check n[0][0]'s order in reverse. the first result should be removed that == n or a should be removed.
7) Depending on the above, n[1].HP = true or a[1].HP = true
